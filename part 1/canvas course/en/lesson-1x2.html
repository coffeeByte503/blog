                    Begins assembling a new set of path commands and also discards any
                    previously assembled path
                </b>
            </p>
            <p>
                The discarding is an important and often overlooked point. If you don't
                begin a new path, any previously issued path commands will automatically
                be redrawn.

                It also moves the drawing "pen" to the top-left origin of the canvas
                coordinate[0, 0].

        <h3>moveTo</h3>
        <div class="code">context.moveTo(startX, startY)</div>
        <article>
            <p>
                <b>
                    Moves the current pen location to the coordinate [startX, startY]
                </b>
            </p>
            <p>
                By default all path drawings are connected together. So the ending point
                of one line or curve is the starting point of the next line or curve.
                This can cause an unexpected line to be drawn connecting two adjacent
                drawings.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <span class="code">context.moveTo()</span> command basically "picks
                up the drawing pen" and places it at a new coordinate so the automatic
                connecting line is not drawn

        <h3>arc</h3>
        <div class="code">
            context.arc(centerX, centerY, radius, startingRadianAngle,

                    Draws a circular arc given a centerpoint, radius and starting & ending
                    angles. The angles are expressed as radians. To convert degrees to
                    radians you can use this formula: <span class="code">radians = degrees * Math.PI / 180;</span>
                </b>
            </p>
            <div class="code">

            </div>
            <p>
                Angle 0 faces directly rightward from the center of the arc. To draw a complete circle you can make
                endingAngle =
                startingAngle + 360 degrees; <i><b>(360 degrees == Math.PI * 2)</b></i>

            <p>
                By default, the arc is drawn clockwise, An optional [true | false]
                parameter instructs the arc to be drawn
                counterclockwise:

                <b>
                    Draws a circular arc with a given radius. The arc is drawn
                    clockwise inside the wedge formed by the current pen
                    location and given two points: Point1 & Point2

        <h3>rect</h3>
        <article>
            <div class="code">
                context.rect(leftX, topY, width, height);
            </div>
            <p>
                <b>
                    Draws a rectangle given a top-left corner and a width & height
                </b>
            </p>
            <p>
                The context.rect is a unique drawing command because it adds disconnected
                rectangles. These disconnected rectangles are not automatically connected by lines.

        <h3>closePath</h3>
        <article>
            <div class="code">
                context.closePath();
            </div>
            <p>
                <b>
                    Draws a line from the current pen location back to the beginning path coordinate
                </b>
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, if you draw 2 lines forming 2 legs of a triangle, closePath
                will "close" the triangle by drawing the third leg of the triangle from
                the 2nd leg's endpoint back to the first leg's starting point

            </p>
            <p>
                This command's name often causes it to be misunderstood.
                <span clas="code">context.closePath</span> is NOT an ending delimiter to
                context.beginPath. Again, the closePath command draws a line
                it does not "close" a beginPath.
